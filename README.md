A simplistic implementation of TCP Stream for a server client connection to transfer data using rust.

This employs Ascynchronous working for sending and receiving data 

## To run the Code:

Open two seperate instances of Terminal and simply perform the following each on one instance:

`cd {client / server}`
`cargo run {client / server}`

**Note:** The server needs to be started first as there won't be a machine to establish connection with for the client otherwise.
